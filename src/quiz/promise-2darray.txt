Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

Ans: 

output :

‚ùØ node src/quiz/promise-2darray.js
Sum called ... 
returning from sum
Promise { <pending> }
Sum called ... 
rejecting ... 
returning from sum
Promise { <rejected> 'BAD INPUT: Expected array as input' }
node:internal/process/promises:289
            triggerUncaughtException(err, true /* fromPromise */);

Explanation : 

The issue in the code is that sumPromise1 and sumPromise2 are promises, and 
when you log them to the console directly after calling sum2DArray, 
you're actually logging the promises themselves, not the resolved values. Promises are asynchronous, 
so you need to wait for them to resolve before accessing their values.


Code changed in the file.

Output: 

Sum called ... 
returning from sum
Sum called ... 
rejecting ... 
returning from sum
BAD INPUT: Expected array as input
resolving ...
